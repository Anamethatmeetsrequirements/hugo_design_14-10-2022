    <h1>Short Description</h1>
    <p>This indicator shows changes in the emissions of the 5 key air pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5),nitrogen oxides (NOX), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and ammonia (NH3). Air pollution has negative impacts on human health and the environment. Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer. As well as being emitted directly, particulate matter can be formed in the atmosphere from reactions between other pollutants, of which SO2, NOX, NMVOCs and NH3 are the most important. NOX and NH3 emissions can be deposited in soils or in rivers and lakes, for example, through rain. Resulting nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses and by producing ozone (O3) which damages crops and leads to impacts on wildlife through enhanced nutrient levels.</p>
    <p>This indicator is an assessment of pressures on the atmosphere caused by the emissions of 5 key pollutants, which when concentrated in the air or deposited have impacts on human health and ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Assessment of change</h2>
<p>Four of the air pollutants measured by the A1 indicator have shown an improvement in the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), and over the medium and long-term time periods. However, emissions of NH3 have been increasing over the short and medium term. More detailed reporting mentioned in the ‘Readiness and links to data’ section for this indicator may provide insights into the factors behind this change in NH3 emissions. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets. <a href="https://naei.beis.gov.uk/overview/making-projections">Projections towards air emissions targets</a> set at a UK scale are available to supplement this assessment.</p>
<p>Change since 2018 has also been assessed. SO2 and NOx emissions showed an improvement in 2019, while NH3, NMVOC and PM2.5 emissions showed little or no change. However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.</p>
<p>Further information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the <a href="https://oifdata.defra.gov.uk/assessment/background">Assessment background</a> page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the <a href="https://oifdata.defra.gov.uk/assessment/results/">Assessment results</a> pages.</p>
